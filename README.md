## Slot Management System

SlotBot uses a comprehensive slot management system that handles the entire lifecycle of a seller slot.

### Slot Creation

When an admin creates a slot:
1. A channel is created for the seller
2. The seller is assigned the seller role
3. The seller receives a restore code via DM
4. The slot information is saved in the database

### Slot Types

SlotBot supports multiple slot types with different durations and ping allowances:

- **Daily**: 1-day duration with 1 @here ping and 0 @everyone pings
- **Weekly**: 7-day duration with 2 @here pings and 1 @everyone ping
- **Monthly**: 30-day duration with 3 @here pings and 1 @everyone ping
- **Lifetime**: Never expires with 4 @here pings and 3 @everyone pings

### Slot Status

Slots can have the following statuses:

- **Active**: The slot is fully functional
- **Revoked**: The seller cannot send messages but the slot still exists
- **About to Expire**: The slot will expire soon
- **Expired**: The slot has reached its end date and will be deleted

### Slot Expiration

The bot automatically checks for expired slots every minute and:
1. Deletes the channel
2. Removes the slot from the database
3. Logs the expiration

## Ping System

SlotBot features a sophisticated ping management system that:

1. **Monitors Messages**: Tracks when sellers use @here and @everyone mentions
2. **Enforces Limits**: Prevents sellers from exceeding their allocated pings
3. **Auto-Revocation**: Automatically revokes slots when ping limits are exceeded
4. **Daily Reset**: Resets ping counters at the configured time every day

### How Pings Work

- Each slot type has a set number of allowed @here and @everyone pings
- When a seller uses a ping, the counter increases
- If a seller exceeds their limit, their slot is automatically revoked
- Ping counters reset daily at the configured time
- Sellers are notified of their remaining pings after each use

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**The bot isn't responding to commands**
- Check if the bot is online and has the correct permissions
- Verify that you're using the correct prefix
- Ensure the command syntax is correct
- Check the console logs for errors

**Slot creation fails**
- Ensure the category IDs in the config are correct
- Verify that the bot has permission to create channels in those categories
- Make sure the categories aren't full (Discord limit is 50 channels per category)

**Ping monitoring doesn't work**
- Check that the bot has permission to read messages in the slot channels
- Verify that the slot is properly registered in the database
- Make sure the user sending the message is the slot owner

**Automatic expiration doesn't happen**
- Check that the bot is running continuously
- Verify that the timezone settings are correct
- Make sure the slots have proper expiration dates in the database

### Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug:

1. **Describe the issue**: What happened? What did you expect to happen?
2. **Steps to reproduce**: How can someone else recreate this issue?
3. **Screenshots**: If applicable, provide screenshots showing the problem
4. **Bot logs**: Share any relevant error messages from the console

Submit bug reports by:
- Creating an issue on the GitHub repository
- Contacting the developer directly via Discord or Telegram (see [Developer Information](#developer-information))
